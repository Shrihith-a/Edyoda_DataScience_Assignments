    "#### **Rules Of \"Tower of Hanoi\"**\n",
    "    - The rules of \"Tower of Hanoi\" are quite simple, but the solution is slightly hard.\n",
    "    - There are three rods. The disks are stacked in the descending order; the largest disk stacked at the bottom and the smallest one on top.\n",
    "    - The task is to transfer the disks from one source rod to another target rod.\n",
    "    - The following rule must not be violated\n",
    "        1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    "        2. The most upper disk from one of the rod can be stimulated in move.\n",
    "        3. The smaller disk cannot be placed at the lower of the largest disk.\n",
    "    - The number of moves can be calculated as 2n - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Solution\n",
    "        - Suppose we have three disks on the first rod; we need total 7 moves from the above formula.\n",
    "        - The most left rod is called SOURCE, and the rightmost rod is called TARGET.\n",
    "        -  The middle rod is referred to as an AUX and The AUX is needed to deposit disks temporarily."
